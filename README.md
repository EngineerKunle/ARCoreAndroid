ARCore SceneForm example for Londroid

This is a playground app for my talk on Londroid Augmented Reality. 

Please feel free to use it as a starter point. 

You will need the 3D assests either from [google poly site] (https://poly.google.com/), or download from 
[AR Sceneform code lab] (https://github.com/googlecodelabs/sceneform-intro/tree/master/sampledata)
